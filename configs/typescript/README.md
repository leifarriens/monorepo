## Configurations

### base.json

For type checking all packages. Uses `bundler` module resolution with extensionless imports. Enables maximum strictness. Does not emit files.

### build-node.json

For building Node.js applications that run directly—CLIs, servers, scripts. Emits `.js` and `.js.map` files. No type declarations since consumers run the code, not import it as a library.

### build-lib.json

For building publishable libraries consumed by other packages or external users. Emits `.js`, `.js.map`, `.d.ts`, and `.d.ts.map` files. Includes declarations so consumers get full type information.

### build-types.json

For building internal monorepo packages where consumers import directly from source. Emits only `.d.ts` and `.d.ts.map` files. Speeds up IDE performance and type checking without duplicating JavaScript that's never runs.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When defining `exports` in package.json, TypeScript reads fields in order and uses the first match. "types" **NEED** to be before "import" to ensure TypeScript resolves .d.ts files instead of falling back to source .ts files.

```json
{
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "types": "./dist/schema.d.ts",
      "import": "./src/schema.ts"
    }
  }
}
```
